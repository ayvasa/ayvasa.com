## Definition

Interoception refers to the capacity to sense and interpret signals originating from within the body. These signals include breath, heartbeat, tension, temperature, pressure, and internal states related to regulation and balance.

## In Ayvasa

Within Ayvasa, interoception is understood as a foundational channel of information rather than a skill to master. As Physiological Settling and coherence improve, interoceptive signals become clearer, more reliable, and less distorted by interpretation or narrative.

Developing interoception does not mean constant inward focus. Instead, it supports more accurate sensing of when to act, rest, adjust, or allow processes to settle on their own.

## How it shows up

- Clearer perception of breath, tension, or internal pressure
- Earlier detection of stress or overload
- Improved ability to sense when regulation is shifting
- Less need to analyze bodily signals cognitively
- Greater trust in subtle bodily feedback

## What it is not

- Hyper-fixation on bodily sensation
- Interpreting every sensation as meaningful
- Emotional introspection or self-analysis
- Something that improves through force or monitoring
