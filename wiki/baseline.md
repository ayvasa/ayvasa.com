## Definition

Baseline refers to the organism’s default level of functioning when no immediate demands or stressors are present. It reflects the underlying tone of regulation, coherence, and responsiveness that a person returns to between events.

## In Ayvasa

Within Ayvasa, baseline is not a fixed trait or achievement. It is a dynamic reference point that can shift gradually as regulation improves and interference decreases. Practice is understood not as producing peak experiences, but as influencing baseline over time.

Changes in baseline are often subtle. They may appear as easier recovery, steadier mood, or reduced background tension rather than dramatic states.

## How it shows up

- Faster settling after disruption
- Less background urgency or strain
- More consistent clarity across ordinary moments
- Reduced dependence on deliberate techniques
- A sense of stability that persists between sessions

## What it is not

- A constant emotional state
- A permanent condition
- Something to optimize or compare
- A measure of personal worth or progress
