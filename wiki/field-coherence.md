## Definition

Field Coherence refers to the degree of alignment and stability within the field of experience. When the field is coherent, perception, sensation, emotion, and action organize smoothly without internal conflict or fragmentation.

## In Ayvasa

Within Ayvasa, Field Coherence is not a mental state or emotional mood. It is a functional condition in which competing signals within the organism settle into coordination. As coherence increases, less effort is required to think, decide, or act.

Field Coherence allows the Automatic Self to function efficiently, the Conscious Self to relax excessive control, and Original Intelligence to come into the foreground of lived experience.

## How it shows up

- Reduced internal noise and contradiction
- Smoother transitions between thought, feeling, and action
- Less reactivity under pressure
- A felt sense of stability or “rightness”
- Increased capacity to respond rather than react

## What it is not

- Constant calm or emotional positivity
- A trance or altered state
- Suppression of thoughts or feelings
- Detachment from practical life
