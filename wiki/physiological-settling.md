## Definition

Physiological Settling refers to the process by which the body’s regulatory systems return toward balance after activation. It involves a reduction in unnecessary tension, reactivity, and internal load at the physiological level.

## In Ayvasa

Within Ayvasa, Physiological Settling is understood as a prerequisite for clarity, coherence, and stability. When the body remains in a state of unresolved activation, attention and insight tend to become effortful or distorted.

Rather than being forced through control or relaxation techniques, settling occurs naturally when conditions support regulation. As the body settles, interference decreases and coordination across systems improves.

## How it shows up

- Slower, more even breathing
- Reduced muscular tension
- Less urgency or internal pressure
- Increased capacity to remain with sensation
- A sense of the body “coming back online”

## What it is not

- Passive collapse or shutdown
- Forcing the body to relax
- Emotional suppression
- A permanent or fixed state
