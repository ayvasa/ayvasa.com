## Definition

The Field of Experience refers to the total, moment-to-moment experiential context in which perception, sensation, emotion, thought, and action arise. It is the immediate “space” of lived experience, prior to interpretation or narrative.

## In Ayvasa

Within Ayvasa, the Field of Experience is used as a neutral, descriptive term rather than a metaphysical claim. It helps distinguish raw experience from the stories, identities, and interpretations layered on top of it.

Understanding experience as a field allows attention to shift from managing individual contents (thoughts, emotions, sensations) to noticing patterns of alignment, interference, and coherence across the whole.

## How it shows up

- Simultaneous awareness of multiple sensations or signals
- Recognition that thoughts and emotions arise within a larger context
- Less fixation on any single experience
- A sense of openness or spaciousness without effort
- Easier detection of interference or misalignment

## What it is not

- A mental construct or visualization
- A metaphysical realm or substance
- Separate from the body or environment
- Something that must be accessed or entered
