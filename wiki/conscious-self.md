## Definition

The Conscious Self refers to the capacity for deliberate attention, reflection, and choice. It is the aspect of experience that can observe, decide, and intentionally direct action.

## In Ayvasa

Within Ayvasa, the Conscious Self is understood as a limited but important function—not the totality of who or what we are. It plays a key role in learning, planning, and self-regulation, but it is not designed to manage every aspect of living.

As coherence increases, the Conscious Self shifts from constant management and correction toward a lighter supervisory role, allowing Automatic Self processes and Original Intelligence to operate more freely.

## How it shows up

- Intentional focus and deliberate decision-making
- Self-reflection and evaluation
- Effortful control or correction of behavior
- Planning, goal-setting, and problem-solving
- A sense of “I am choosing” or “I am doing”

## What it is not

- The true or final self
- The source of all intelligence or insight
- Capable of sustaining total control over experience
- Meant to run the organism continuously
