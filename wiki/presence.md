## Definition

Presence refers to the capacity to remain attentively available to what is occurring, without excessive distraction or mental avoidance. It involves conscious contact with experience as it unfolds.

## In Ayvasa

Within Ayvasa, Presence is understood as a *function* rather than an achievement. It is the ability of the Conscious Self to stay oriented toward immediate experience. Presence alone does not guarantee clarity, ease, or coherence—it simply keeps experience in view.

Presence becomes most effective when supported by Field Coherence. Without coherence, presence can feel effortful or strained. With coherence, presence becomes lighter, more natural, and less self-conscious.

## How it shows up

- Attentive listening or observation
- Awareness of bodily sensation and emotion
- Reduced distraction or mental drifting
- A felt sense of “being here”
- Willingness to stay with experience

## What it is not

- A permanent state
- Emotional calm or positivity
- A guarantee of insight or wisdom
- The same as coherence or awakening
