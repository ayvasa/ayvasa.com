## Definition

Coherence refers to the degree to which internal processes—perception, sensation, emotion, thought, and action—operate in coordination rather than conflict. Higher coherence means less internal contradiction and more efficient functioning.

## In Ayvasa

Within Ayvasa, coherence is not treated as a state of mind or emotional quality. It is a functional condition of the organism. When coherence increases, fewer internal resources are spent managing friction, allowing action and perception to become simpler and more stable.

Coherence is not something achieved through effort. It emerges naturally as interference settles and regulation improves. Field Coherence describes this condition at the level of the whole field of experience.

## How it shows up

- Reduced internal conflict or mixed signals
- Smoother transitions between thoughts, feelings, and actions
- Less effort required to decide or act
- Greater consistency across situations
- A felt sense of alignment or “things working together”

## What it is not

- Emotional calm or positivity
- A meditative trance or altered state
- The same as presence or attention
- Something that can be forced or maintained
