## Definition

Effort refers to the application of conscious energy to influence attention, behavior, or internal state. It is the felt sense of “trying” or exerting control within experience.

## In Ayvasa

Within Ayvasa, effort is not treated as inherently good or bad. Some effort is necessary for learning, coordination, and deliberate action. Problems arise when effort is used to compensate for low coherence or unresolved interference.

As coherence and regulation improve, the need for compensatory effort decreases. Action becomes simpler, quieter, and more efficient, while appropriate effort remains available when genuinely required.

## How it shows up

- Intentional focus or control
- Sustaining attention through will
- Managing or correcting internal experience
- A felt sense of strain or exertion
- Fatigue following prolonged control

## What it is not

- The same as engagement or care
- Always necessary for effective action
- A sign of progress or depth
- Something that must be eliminated
