## Definition

False Presence refers to a condition in which attention appears stable or focused, but underlying tension, effort, or self-monitoring remains active. The surface of experience feels “present,” while deeper layers remain unsettled.

## In Ayvasa

Within Ayvasa, False Presence is not considered a failure or deception. It often develops in practitioners who have trained attention without addressing underlying coherence. The Conscious Self learns to hold focus, but the field remains fragmented or strained.

This can create the impression of depth or clarity while masking subtle effort, control, or suppression. Over time, False Presence can lead to fatigue, rigidity, or diminished sensitivity.

## How it shows up

* Sustained attention accompanied by tension or effort
* A controlled or “held” quality in awareness
* Reduced emotional range or spontaneity
* Subtle self-monitoring while being “present”
* Fatigue after periods of mindful attention

## What it is not

* Lack of sincerity or commitment
* A moral or spiritual failing
* The same as distraction or absence
* Something that must be forcibly corrected
