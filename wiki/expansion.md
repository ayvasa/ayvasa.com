## Definition
Expansion (Phase 3) is the natural release of contraction that occurs when safety and slowness are established. It is a feeling of opening up, softening boundaries, and spaciousness.

## Not Doing, But Allowing
You cannot force expansion. It happens on its own when the conditions (Arrival, Inwardness, Deceleration) are met. It is like a clenched fist relaxing into an open palm.

## Experience
- The body may feel lighter or larger.
- The breath may become very subtle.
- A sense of benevolence or ease may arise.
