## Definition

Still Point refers to a moment or period in which internal activity temporarily settles to a minimum. It is characterized by reduced interference, quiet coordination, and the absence of felt urgency.

## In Ayvasa

Within Ayvasa, the Still Point is not treated as a goal or special state to achieve. It is a natural byproduct of sufficient Physiological Settling and Field Coherence. When competing signals resolve, activity briefly stabilizes on its own.

The Still Point is not an endpoint. It often functions as a transitional condition from which clarity, insight, or Original Intelligence can emerge.

## How it shows up

- A sudden or gradual quieting of internal activity
- Absence of effort or striving
- A neutral, steady sense of stability
- Clear perception without commentary
- A feeling that nothing needs to happen

## What it is not

- Dissociation or shutdown
- Loss of awareness
- A trance or altered state
- Something that can be sustained by force
