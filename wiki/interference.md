## Definition

Interference refers to any internal activity that disrupts the natural coordination of perception, sensation, emotion, and action. It appears as noise, friction, or misalignment within the field of experience.

## In Ayvasa

Within Ayvasa, Interference is not treated as a problem to eliminate, but as a signal indicating reduced coherence. It can arise from unresolved stress, learned conditioning, cognitive overactivity, or physiological imbalance.

Rather than resisting or suppressing interference, the aim is to allow it to settle through improved regulation and alignment. As interference decreases, functioning becomes simpler and more efficient.

## How it shows up

- Persistent mental commentary or looping
- Contradictory impulses or internal friction
- Emotional reactivity disproportionate to the situation
- Difficulty transitioning between states or tasks
- A sense of effort or strain in ordinary action

## What it is not

- A personal flaw or failure
- Something caused by thinking itself
- Evidence of “doing it wrong”
- An enemy to fight or remove
