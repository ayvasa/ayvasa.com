## Definition

Wave Learning refers to the non-linear pattern by which regulation, coherence, and functional capacity develop over time. Progress unfolds in cycles of settling, disruption, integration, and re-stabilization rather than in a straight line.

## In Ayvasa

Within Ayvasa, learning is understood as a biological and experiential process that moves in waves. Periods of clarity or ease are often followed by plateaus, fluctuations, or temporary regressions as the system integrates change.

These fluctuations are not signs of failure. They indicate that underlying patterns are reorganizing. Recognizing wave learning helps reduce self-judgment and supports sustained practice without overcorrecting or forcing progress.

## How it shows up

- Alternating periods of ease and difficulty
- Temporary loss of clarity after apparent improvement
- Plateaus where little seems to change
- Sudden integration following periods of instability
- Gradual baseline shifts rather than constant gains

## What it is not

- Inconsistency caused by lack of effort
- A sign that practice is ineffective
- Something to optimize or eliminate
- A problem to be fixed
