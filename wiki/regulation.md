## Definition

Regulation refers to the organism’s capacity to modulate internal states in response to changing conditions. It involves adjusting levels of arousal, attention, and responsiveness to meet the demands of the moment.

## In Ayvasa

Within Ayvasa, regulation is understood as a functional ability rather than a technique or mindset. A well-regulated system can activate when needed and settle when conditions allow, without becoming stuck in extremes.

Regulation supports Physiological Settling and Field Coherence by preventing prolonged overactivation or suppression. As regulation improves, less conscious effort is required to manage experience.

- Greater tolerance for intensity without reactivity
- More consistent functioning across situations

## What it is not

- Constant calm or low arousal
- Emotional control or suppression
- A personality trait
- Something achieved through willpower alone
