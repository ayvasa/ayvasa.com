## Definition

Zero Field refers to the condition of minimal interference within the field of experience. It is not an object of perception, but a baseline state in which internal activity is sufficiently quiet for other processes to organize clearly.

## In Ayvasa

Within Ayvasa, the Zero Field is not treated as a metaphysical source or ultimate reality. It describes a functional condition in which noise, tension, and competing signals have settled to near zero. From this condition, clarity, coherence, and Original Intelligence can emerge more readily.

The Zero Field is not something to enter or maintain. It appears naturally when the organism is adequately regulated and aligned.

## How it shows up

- A sense of internal quiet without dullness
- Absence of urgency, striving, or internal pressure
- Neutral clarity rather than emotional intensity
- Increased sensitivity to subtle signals
- Ease without effort

## What it is not

- A void or dissociative state
- Emotional numbness
- A transcendent or mystical realm
- A permanent condition
