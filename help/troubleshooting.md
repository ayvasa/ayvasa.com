## My sessions disappeared

Local browser data may have been cleared. If possible, restore from a backup if one already exists.

## I switched devices and see no sessions

Data does not sync automatically. It is recommended to use one dedicated device for Ayvasa. However, if you switched to a new device, you should export your data from the other device and import it on the new one.

## Something feels off

This is not a performance or optimization app. 

Progress here is often subtle and non-linear.
