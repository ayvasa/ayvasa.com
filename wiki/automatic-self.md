## Definition

The Automatic Self refers to the collection of learned patterns that run perception, emotion, thought, and behavior without conscious intention. It is the organism’s adaptive operating system, shaped by biology, conditioning, and experience.

## In Ayvasa

Within Ayvasa, the Automatic Self is not an enemy to overcome or dismantle. It is a necessary and highly intelligent layer of functioning that handles most moment-to-moment activity. Problems arise not from its existence, but from unconscious identification with it—when its outputs are mistaken for a central “me.”

As coherence increases, the Automatic Self continues to function, but with less internal noise, reactivity, and self-referential looping.

## How it shows up

- Habitual thoughts, reactions, and emotional responses
- Learned preferences, aversions, and coping strategies
- Predictable behavioral patterns in familiar situations
- Fast, efficient action without deliberation
- Stress or reactivity when overloaded or incoherent

## What it is not

- A flaw or defect to eliminate
- A false self that must be destroyed
- Conscious intention or deliberate choice
- The source of Original Intelligence
