## Definition

Identity Dissolution refers to a temporary or partial loosening of identification with habitual self-references, roles, and narratives. The sense of “who I am” becomes less fixed, less central, or less compelling.

## In Ayvasa

Within Ayvasa, Identity Dissolution is understood as a functional shift rather than a loss of self. It occurs when coherence increases and the Automatic Self is no longer being continuously reinforced by self-referential activity.

This process is not inherently destabilizing. When supported by Physiological Settling and Field Coherence, identity can soften without disorientation, allowing action and perception to become more direct and less constrained.

## How it shows up

- Reduced attachment to personal narratives or roles
- Less concern with self-image or self-definition
- A quieter sense of “me” in the background
- Increased flexibility in behavior and response
- Moments of functioning without self-reference

## What it is not

- Loss of personality or memory
- Dissociation or depersonalization
- Psychological fragmentation
- A permanent condition or goal
