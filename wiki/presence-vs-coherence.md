## Definition

Presence and Coherence refer to related but distinct aspects of experience. Presence describes attentional availability, while coherence describes the degree of internal alignment and coordination within the field of experience.

## In Ayvasa

Within Ayvasa, Presence is understood as a function of attention. It reflects the capacity of the Conscious Self to stay oriented toward what is occurring. Coherence, by contrast, reflects how well internal systems are working together, regardless of where attention is directed.

Presence can exist without coherence, which often results in effortful or strained awareness. Coherence can also increase without deliberate presence, leading to smoother functioning and reduced interference. When both are present, experience becomes clear, stable, and largely unselfconscious.

## How the difference shows up

- Presence without coherence often feels effortful or controlled
- Presence with coherence feels light, natural, and sustainable
- Coherence without deliberate presence often shows up as ease in action
- Coherence reduces the need for constant attentional management
- Increased coherence naturally supports more stable presence

## What this distinction avoids

- Treating presence as the ultimate goal
- Assuming attention alone produces clarity
- Confusing effortful awareness with depth
- Overemphasizing technique over regulation
